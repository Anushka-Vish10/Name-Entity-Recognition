# Name-Entity-Recognition

What does named entity recognition do? Named entity recognition is a natural language processing technique that can automatically scan entire document and pull out some fundamental entities in a text and classify them into predefined categories

There are six NER model present in this repository, 

NER performed using Spacy, bert-base, custom bert model, bert-large-base, roberta-base-model and by using Azure congnetive service text analytics

On a comparision over these models we come to figure out,  NER by using azure service and NER using bert-large model performs quite well over the rest.
